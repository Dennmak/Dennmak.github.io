## What is Network Topology?

Have you ever wondered what network topology is? Well you're in the right place! Network topology is the physical and logical portrayal of a network. It means it's basically a map of what a network looks like and it shows all the devices that is in it and potentially the data flows through it. It's similar to a spider web that's interconnected with many devices on one network. 

I'll be showing various network set ups and examples that may help you understand with the hopes that you'll be able to create your own networks in the future. Get ready, let's go!
