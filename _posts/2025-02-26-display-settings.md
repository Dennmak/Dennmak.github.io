## The Brightness Bar

The brightness option allows you to edit the brightness levels of your monitor so you either make it very dark, very bright, or just right. It allows the option to prevent temporary blindness and to avoid light mode at all costs.

1.) Select the brightness slider and drag it to adjust it to your desired brightness level.

## The Night Light

The night light option allows you to enable warmer colors on your display to block blue light. This allows for an experience that's easier on the eyes if you're working late into the night.

1.) Toggle the button to the **On** to enable night light or the **Off** option to disable it.
