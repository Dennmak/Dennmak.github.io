## What is SNMP?

Have you wondered what SNMP is? Well I have the answer for you! SNMP is a protocol used in networking that allows for monitoring and managing network devices. This allows network administrators or in this case you, to gather diagnosdtic data and other information about their network. It's an efficient way to gather data that can be used for troubleshooting and other tasks.

## Let's Get Started!

Today we're going to set up SNMP in a simple network so you can see how to get started and how it works. We're going to be using Cisco Packet Tracer and it'll be simulating what you can do with actual hardware that you may have at home. Let's go!

## Network Creation

We're going to get started by setting up a small network. This will consist of 3 PC's, a switch, and a router. Drag these onto your canvas in any format you desire.
