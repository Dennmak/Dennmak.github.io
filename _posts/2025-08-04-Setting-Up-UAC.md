## What is UAC?

What is UAC, you say? You're in the right place! UAC, or user account control, is a security measure for Windows put in place to keep users safe. Try thinking of it as a checkpoint or barrier with a guard who asks you where you're going and why you need access. It focuses on the premise of least privilege, which provides users with the tools they need to do their jobs and nothing more or less. 

Whenever an application tries to make an administrative change on your device, UAC will have a notification pop up, warning you and asking you if you want to give permission or not. If you deny it, that application cannot proceed further; if you accept it, then you give permission for that application to complete its task.

## Why is this important?

Malicious applications called malware want to gain access to your devices. Why does this matter? It gives bad actors a foothold into your system so they can do whatever they please, ranging from stealing information, changing your credentials, and even remotely taking over your system! An example of remote takeovers is ransomware, where a bad actor can lock your computer, encrypt your files, and demand payment or else your files will be deleted or released all over the internet.

## Let's Get Started

We're going to do a surface dive into UAC and do an introduction which will get you familiar with what UAC is, what it looks like, and what it does. You'll then be prepared to customize your options to achieve your security goals.

## Where the Magic Happens

This is the UAC console, which is where we'll be exploring our customization options and where you'll see the visual GUI of what UAC does. There's a slider bar which allows you to either scroll up or down, and each option will show what it provides or what it lacks.

## Anarchy Reigns

The first option that we have is the ability to turn off UAC completely and turn off notifications. This will disable notifications for when you make changes to Windows, and it'll also not warn you about programs that make administrative changes and modifications to your computer. It's the equivalent of having the wild west on your computer, and anything goes. This option is very unsafe, and I do not recommend it at all because it disables security for your computer. It's the equivalent of a hacker's paradise, and it lets them do whatever they want.

Think of it as sitting in a house that's burning down around you or a frog sitting in a pot with boiling water that gets hotter and hotter. The meme below portrays exactly my point!
