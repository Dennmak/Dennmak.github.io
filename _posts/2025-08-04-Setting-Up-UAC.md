## What is UAC?

What is UAC, you say? You're in the right place! UAC, or user account control, is a security measure for Windows put in place to keep users safe. Try thinking of it as a checkpoint or barrier with a guard who asks you where you're going and why you need access. It focuses on the premise of least privilege, which provides users with the tools they need to do their jobs and nothing more or less. Whenever an application tries to make an administrative change on your device, UAC will have a notification pop up, warning you and asking you if you want to give permission or not. If you deny it, that application cannot proceed further; if you accept it, then you give permission for that application to complete its task.

## Why is this important?

Malicious applications called malware want to gain access to your devices. Why does this matter? It gives bad actors a foothold into your system so they can do whatever they please, ranging from stealing information, changing your credentials, and even remotely taking over your system! An example of remote takeovers is ransomware, where a bad actor can lock your computer, encrypt your files, and demand payment or else your files will be deleted or released all over the internet.

## Let's Get Started

We're going to do a surface dive into UAC and do an introduction, which will get you familiar with what UAC is, what it looks like, and what it does. You'll then be prepared to customize your options to achieve your security goals.
