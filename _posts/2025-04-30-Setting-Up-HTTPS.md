## What's HTTPS and HTTP?

What is HTTPS and HTTP you say? You've come to the right place! HTTP is a protocol that allows browsers and servers to communicate over the internet. It transfers data all over the internet so you can browse web pages! The downside is that HTTP is not encrypted meaning that your information can be intercepted and read! HTTPS is the same as HTTP but it's a step up because it's encrypted. This adds what is basically a shield over your information so that other parties can't snoop around and steal your information.

## What's the Plan?

We're going to be using Cisco Packet Tracer to set up a network which has a HTTP and HTTPS server in it and then connect to an IP using both HTTP and HTTPS to test that it actually works. Get ready to follow along or you might get lost along the way!

## Let's Get Started!

So we're going to get Cisco Packet Tracer fired up and then we're going to set up the framework for our network. Start off by placing 2 PC's, 1 switch, 2 servers, and a router. This is going to be how our network is going to look.

Next we're going to connect our devices. Head to the connections tab and select **automatically choose connection type**.

Now, connect both of your PC's to the switch. Then connect each server to the switch. Finally, connect the router to the switch.
