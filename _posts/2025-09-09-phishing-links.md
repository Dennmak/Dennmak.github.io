## What is Phishing?

What is phishing, you say? Phishing is when malicious actors impersonate others to steal sensitive information from other people using malicious links. They use delivery methods and platforms such as emails, text messages, and social media. The primary method they use is by sending emails to other users, and in these emails, there are malicious links. They cast out bait and hope that someones take a bite, and that bite could be you! That's why it's called phishing because it's basically fishing in the digital world!

These links are usually hidden in buttons or other places where you don't expect them. These links lead to malicious websites that collect your information, such as usernames and passwords. The attackers are then able to use these credentials to log into systems that you may have access to or accounts that you use. Now you have a compromised account, and your information is at risk! It's a huge headache to clean up.

## Why is this Important?

Bad actors use phishing as a means of getting access to systems and getting a hold of confidential information. A user can send out 1,000 malicious emails, and 999 people could spot it, but it takes only 1 person to make a mistake. Those mistakes can be costly and cause great harm, and sometimes you don't even know that the link you clicked was malicious. Your credit card, social security, bank account information, and other information can be accessed just because you clicked a link! It's a big deal, and it greatly emphasises why you should pay attention when you're surfing the internet.

## Social What?

Another topic that goes hand in hand with phishing is social engineering. Social engineering is a method of social hacking that includes manipulating individuals in order for them to do something that one desires without them being aware. Examples of this include convincing someone to reveal confidential information, convincing them to change a password, or creating a sense of urgency that forces a person to act on their emotions. It also consists of gaining a person's trust and taking advantage of that trust so that they perform a task for you. It's one of the main tools in a hacker's tool belt, and it's very effective.

## What's the Plan Today?

Today, we're going to be analyzing a phishing email that had malicious intent. We're going to be looking at the sender, titles, email structure, and how to check if the link or payload in the email is malicious. Hopefully, this will equip you to spot these pesky emails and keep you and others safe from these bad actors.

## The Tools of the Trade

The tool we're going to be using today is VirusTotal. It's a free tool that allows you to scan a URL or file, and it'll report back whether it's malicious or not. It scans the said file or URL with security vendors and the community, and you get a response when it's done. This is basically what OSINT (open source intelligence) is all about. OSINT is the gathering and analysis of public information and gaining intelligence out of it. It's a huge blessing because it's not locked behind a paywall, and you can do it straight from your home.
