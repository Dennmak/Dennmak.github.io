## Windows 11 - I Can Change My Text?

Have you ever felt that the text in Windows 11 is bland, boring, and needs a little spice? Have you thought that the on-screen keyboard needs a little TLC? If yes, Windows gives you the option to change these options and create the visual experience you desire. The opportunities aren't endless, but they do give you a wide variety that allow you to customize the UI to different colors so it's not just gray or black.

The topics we'll be addressing today are how to find your text input settings in Windows 11, how to access them, and how to edit them to create your own unique visual experience. You might be a bit confused now,  but at the end of the tutorial, you'll be able to turn Windows 11 into something that you truly enjoy. Let's get started!

## Where do I Find Settings?

The most important step of changing your text settings is knowing how to get there. Windows 11 has a habit of moving what we're used to into different categories. Now we practically need a map to navigate this digital forest! 

1.) In your search bar at the bottom of your screen type in **settings**.

## Text Input Menu

We have arrived at our destination and this is where all the fun will happen! Here in the text menu, we'll be changing the color of our on-screen keyboard, parts of our UI, and other options. There's also the ability to change the UI colors for the emoji and voice text options! We've spent enough time here, let's keep going!

1) Click the **Emoji and more** box to access your emoji box.

Here you can use emojis and gifs when writing! It's a unique feature that I recently found myself.

2.) Exit out of the Emoji box with the X in the top right corner and select the **voice typing** box.

We have discovered the voice typing box! This allows you to type with your voice! It's a unique accessibility feature that provides an option to type without a keyboard.

## Theme Selection

Here we have the option to select a color theme for the UI. As you switch through the colors, you can see that they change in your preview box. On my screen, I have selected the black theme and it's now previewing in the box. Experiment for a bit to see which color you enjoy the most!

## Custom Theme - True Customization

We have come to the exciting part, are you ready? With a custom theme, you're able to fine-tune and pick what colors you want from a swatch. This allows you to manually pick what you want and to create a truly unique outcome. Let's get started!

1.) Press the **+** on the custom theme box to access the custom theme menu.
