## What is DHCP?

There are many acronyms in the tech world and today's acronym will be DHCP or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. This is a protocol that eliminates the need for manual assignment of IP addresses to devices and allows for automatic IP assigning to devices. It makes life a lot easier and reduces congestion in networks. Who doesn't love automation?

## How to Set Up DHCP

Today we're going to be using Cisco Packet Tracer to set up and configure DHCP in a router which will be the focal point for communication between switches and devices. This will be a digital representation which will mimick a real life scenario with actual hardware. Ready? Let's go!

## The Show Begins

We'll start off with opening Cisco Packet Tracer. On start up you'll have a blank canvas with nothing on it.

In the bottom left corner select **Network Devices**, after that select **router** and then the **2911** router. Drag this router onto your canvas in any spot that you desire!

Next, select **Network Devices** and then go to the **switch** tab. You will select the **2960** device and drag two of them onto your canvas.

You'll now have two switches and a router on your canvas! Isn't it beautiful?

Next, select the **end devices** tab and select the **PC**. We're going to place 6 of these PC's onto our canvas.

## It's Time to Connect

Now, we're going to connect our router to our switches.

Head to the **connections** tab and select **copper straight-through**.
