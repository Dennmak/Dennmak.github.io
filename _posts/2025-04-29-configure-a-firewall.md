## How to Set Up a Firewall

Ever wondered how to set up a firewall? Well, I'm going to show you today using Cisco Packet Tracer! What's a firewall you say? No, a firewall isn't a giant wall made out of fire but a security measure in a network that acts as a barrier. It monitors inbound and outbound traffic based on what rules are in place. 

Why's it needed? Well, think of your front door being unlocked and anyone can get in. A firewall is the equivalent of a lock and a security guard making sure that only those who are allowed are able to get in.

Anywho, let's get started and get this basic firewall up and running!
