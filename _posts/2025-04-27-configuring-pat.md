## Port Address Translation (PAT)

What's a PAT? Well, I'm glad you asked. PAT is a type of network address translation that lets devices on a private network to share a single public IP address by using many different port numbers. It maps multiple private IP addresses and ports to a single IP address and a different port number for each connection. Exciting, I know! 

We're going to set up and configure a PAT using Cisco Packet Tracer. IIt might get a little complicated and tedious but I trust you'll get it down. Are you ready? Let's get started.
