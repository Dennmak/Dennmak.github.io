## It's Proxy Time

What is a proxy server? You've come to the right place! A proxy server has a special purpose, it acts as an intermediary between a device and the internet. Why is this important? It allows for more privacy, security, and can even allow one to bypass geographical restrictions such as national firewalls.

Today we're going to be using Cisco Packet Tracer to create a proxy server and you can follow along to see how I do it. Ready? Let's go!

## The Journey Begins

Once you open Cisco Packet Tracer you'll have a fresh blank canvas. We're going to start off by placing PC's on our canvas.

Head to the lower left corner and select **end devices** and select **PC**. We're going to place **four** computers on our canvas.

Now we have four computers! Aren't they beautiful?

Next, we're going to place down two switches.

Head to **network devices** and then to the **switch tab**. We're going to select the **2960** and place two of them on our screen.

Now we have 2 switches and 4 computers, our ecosystem is growing!

Next, we're going to add a router to keep our other devices company.

Go to the **network devices** tab and select **router**. We're going to be using the **4331** router today.

Our network is growing! Isn't it great?
