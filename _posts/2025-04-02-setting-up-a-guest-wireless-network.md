## How Do I Set Up a Guest Network?

How you ever wondered how to set up a guest network? Do you want to keep others away from your trinkets? I'm going to be using Cisco Packet Tracer today to simulate how one would set up a guest network on their router. 

It seems complicated but at the end of this tutorial you'll have an idea of how it works and be able to make your own! Visitors to your home will be so excited to have wifi access! Woohoo! Let's get started!

## Let's Get Started!

When you open up Cisco Packet Tracer for the first time you'll be greeted by a blank canvas without any models on it. This is where we'll be starting our project and making our guest network.

Select the **Wireless Devices** tab and a line of devices should pop up.

Find **Home Router** and drag and place it on your blank canvas and a router should appear!

Next we'll go to the **End Devices** tab and we'll click on **Laptop** and place 2 of them on the canvas.

After you placed them on the canvas, you'll see a router and two laptops on your screen.
