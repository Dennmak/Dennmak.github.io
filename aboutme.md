Hey, I’m Dennis Maksimov, someone who’s always been curious about how things work, helping others, and passionate about everything that is technology.

I started out taking apart computers just to see if I could put them back together, which evolved into wondering how I could help others with their technology problems. That curiosity led me to earn a degree in Computer Networking Management, and the desire to continue to help others led me to the decision to pursue a bachelor’s in Cybersecurity. Along the way, I picked up certifications like CompTIA A+, ISC2 CC, CompTIA Network+, and I'm currently working towards Security+, and other certificates.

Right now, I’m a Cybersecurity Intern at a medical organization, where I help monitor threats, respond to security incidents, and work with different teams to keep things running smoothly. I also enjoy diving into hands-on labs with TryHackMe and LetsDefend, building out my tech blog, and learning new tools and concepts every day. Whether it's SIEM platforms like Splunk, OSINT tools such as VirusTotal, or setting up virtual machines, I want to get my hands on everything I can find. The learning never stops.

Before tech, I spent 10+ years in retail and healthcare, where I learned how to solve problems fast, stay calm under pressure, and treat everyone with empathy and respect. I carry those skills with me into every project and ticket I touch. Now my desire is to get into cybersecurity and truly pursue what I enjoy doing, protecting others, and helping people navigate the digital frontier known as the internet.

I’m always open to connecting with like-minded folks in tech. Let’s connect!

This website is where I’ll document my learning journey, share insights, and explore the ever-evolving world of tech, and hopefully try to keep up. Thanks for stopping by!
