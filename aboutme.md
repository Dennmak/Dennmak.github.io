### My story

My name is Dennis Maksimov and for the past decade, I've been in the hospital maintenance and retail industry. I've seen everything you can think of seeing and I've dealt with it ranging from broken pipes, overflowing toilets, to rambunctious customers who truly desire for you to have character development. I've built up a unique set of troubleshooting skills that have been battle-tested and I feel as if I'm now equipped to face any challenge that gets thrown at me. 

Since I was young I've had a passion for technology which consisted of dismantling family computers, Game Boys, and cell phones to understand how they work and to learn how to fix them before my parents found out. Now that I'm a lot older, I've decided to pursue technology and go all in on IT, networking, and cybersecurity. My main goals are aimed towards networking and eventually a long-term goal of pivoting toward cybersecurity. 

As of now, I've obtained an associate of science in computer network management and my CompTIA A+. My next items on the to do list are the network+, security, and the cysa+. Therefore, I plan to share my learning journey, document my findings, and explore the world of tech with this here website.
