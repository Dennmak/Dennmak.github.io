I’m Dennis Maksimov and for the past decade, I’ve worked in hospital maintenance and the retail industry. If you can think of a problem, I’ve probably dealt with it whether it was burst pipes, overflowing toilets, or customers who seemed determined to help me with my character development. Through it all, I’ve built a rock-solid set of troubleshooting skills, sharpened under pressure, and I’m confident that I can tackle any challenge thrown my way.

Believe it or not, technology has always been my true passion. Since childhood, I’ve been the kind of person who couldn’t resist taking apart family computers, Game Boys, and cell phones just to see how they worked and, hopefully, put them back together before my parents noticed. That curiosity never faded, and now I’m fully committed to jumping into IT, networking, and cybersecurity.

I hold an Associate of Science in Computer Network Management and have earned my CompTIA A+. Next up is the Network+, Security+, and CySA+, and more as I continue building my expertise with the ultimate goal of transitioning into networking and cybersecurity.

This website is where I’ll document my learning journey, share insights, and explore the ever-evolving world of tech. Thanks for stopping by!
